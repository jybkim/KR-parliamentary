### About the Dataset

[Data Source](https://sites.google.com/site/knemoto1978/NA%20Elections%201988-2016.xlsx?attredirects=0): <https://sites.google.com/site/knemoto1978/kuniakinemotodata>

*Data on 1988-2016 Parliamentary Elections in South Korea*
*from Kuniaki Nemoto, Assistant Professor of Political Science at* 
*Musashi University* 


### Goals for the Project

In the about document, link to the repo as follows:

## Code for the Project 

### Reading in the Datasets

```{r, echo = TRUE}

# read in the excel file, single member district Excel sheet

SMD <- read_excel("NA Elections 1988-2016.xlsx", sheet = "SMD", 
                  col_types = "list") %>%
  clean_names()

# New names for gender issued, this may be because gender values are
# all in Korean


```

```{r, echo = TRUE}

# read in the excel file, proportional Excel sheet

PR <- read_excel("NA Elections 1988-2016.xlsx", sheet = "PR",
                 col_types = "list") %>%
  clean_names()


```

### Clean the Datasets to Prepare for Join

#### PR Dataset

```{r, echo = TRUE}


# purpose of cleaning up PR: 
# to remove unnecessary PR candidate information 
# only to get nationwide vote share

# dae = the nth parliamentary election
# 13th is 1988
# election every 4 years

# change dae into year, but first make column dae numeric

PR$dae <- as.numeric(PR$dae)

# couldn't figure out how to do function, so do it manually
